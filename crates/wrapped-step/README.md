nimble-wrapped-step is a Rust crate that provides wrapped steps (actions, decisions) for
serialization and deserialization, useful in deterministic simulations and networked applications.
It wraps generic steps for easy serialization and deserialization into octet streams, leveraging
the power of types like GenericOctetStep and WrappedOctetStep.

# nimble-step-types

`nimble-step-types` is a Rust library that provides types to represent steps (moves or inputs) in deterministic game simulations. These types are designed to help manage both authoritative and predicted steps from participants in multiplayer games, making it easier to handle game state synchronization.

## Features

- **Authoritative Steps**: Stores validated game moves from participants.
- **Predicted Steps**: Manages locally predicted moves for smoother gameplay experience.

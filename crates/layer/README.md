built-in latency measurement and metrics. It is designed to facilitate reliable communication by
ensuring the order of datagrams and tracking performance metrics for datagram drops.

## âœ¨ Features

 (discards out of order and duplicated datagrams).
- Datagram Drop Tracking: Monitors and records dropped datagrams to help identify network issues.
